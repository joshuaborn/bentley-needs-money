[Bentley Needs Money](https://bentleyneeds.money) is an open source web application that I developed in the spirit of ["eating your own dog food"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food) as a way to refresh my software engineering skills and to fulfill a use case I myself frequently use. It is named after Bentley the dog, because many of the expenses split in my household pertain to taking care of Bentley, who is known for his underbite, freckles, floppy ears, and for being a very, very good boy.
