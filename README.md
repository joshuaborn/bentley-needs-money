# README

This is a Ruby on Rails version 7 app to replace use of Splitwise for my wife and I. I have chosen to build a Splitwise replacement under the eat-your-own-dog-food philosophy.

I am developing this app in order to re-learn Ruby on Rails, get up to speed on changes to Ruby on Rails since I last did software development, and to be a demonstration app while I am interviewing for jobs.
